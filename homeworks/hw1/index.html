        <h2><em>Mechanical Engineering, MS</em></h2>
        <p>I am mechanical engineer with an electrical engineering problem. I am 
            currently working for a direct air capture company workinig to 
            reverse climate change by lowering the concentration of carbon 
            dioxide in the air. I get work at the intersection of hardware and
            software, which I enjoy.
        </p>
        <p>There is so much more about me than school and work! I am an outdoor
            enthusiast, who enjoys everything from running long distances in 
            the mountains (like 100 miles!), kayaking off waterfalls, and eating
            delicious food. I love travelling and learning new languages. I can't
            wait to be done with school so I can spend more time being immersed 
            in different cultures. Also, I have a chunko dog named Koda who is 
            part malamute, husky, and pig. He has the lightest blue eyes you've 
            ever seen and would steal a cookie from a baby.

        <p>My favorite places to eat in Berkeley:
            <ul>
                <li>Tane Vegan Izakaya (Vegan Sushi!)</li>
                <li>MoMo Masala's (Chili Paneer!)</li>
                <li>LuLu's (brunch!)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>I learned that I should be thinking of design in everyday life.
                For the past many years I have been engineering focused and have 
                been looking around me to see examples of engineering work in the
                world, much like that I should be looking at apps, websites, etc 
                with a designers eye.

                My favorite part of the article was deconstructing the apps.
                Although it was almost like they were reconstructing them piece
                by piece. It really helped me get their point about paying attention
                to the small details and think through the 'why' behind their design.

                My favorite quote is "Know the rules, so you can break em", basically
                how can you not love this quote. I like to think I live my life by this
                ethos. But it also makes a good point with design; if you analyze enough
                apps in a design focused way (know the rules), eventually you will identify
                ways to make the design even better and therefore be breaking the rules.

                10 - I liked that it was a short read with interesting content 
                I will take the main message away with me.
