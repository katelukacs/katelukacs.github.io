							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the Gestalt principles and how to apply them to improve UI design.
								The basis of the principles are emergence, reification, multi-stability, and invariance, which
								describe the ways in which we interact with objects. I also learned about common fate where elements that 
								move towards the same direction are thought to be related and if in different directions -- unrelated.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was when it talked about asymmetry within symmetry.
								Symmetrical elements give the sense of order and belonging. They are simple and pleasing to 
								the eye. However too much symmetry can make a layout a bit boring and bringing in asymmetrical 
								elements can draw a users attention if well placed.
