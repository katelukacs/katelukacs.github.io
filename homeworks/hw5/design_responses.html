                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> From this article I learned that there are so many ways to improve UI. 
                                There were 10 great examples of UI that make visiting these sites more enjoyable.
                                I learned not to accept a static unimpressive UI. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was watching all of the user interactioins.
                                I enjoyed seeing how the different UI felt to me as compared to their more
                                boring counterparts. In particular I liked the transition of the very first
                                UI (Welcome screen/login by Andrej Radisic) </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> One of my favorties waas the Selected Works Transitions Experiments by Zhenya Rynzhuk for Sochnik. 
                                I loved how the site came alive in different ways. I also really liked 
                                the Nike one, as I buy a lot of running shoes and the current experience
                                is kinda meh. It made the buying process no the phone not only more user
                                friendly but also fun and high tech. </p>
