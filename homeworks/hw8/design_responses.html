				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that there is a term (Dark Patterns) for many of those annoying things that try to trick you on the internet.  
							I also learned about big picture effects of dark patterns, which is kind of alarming. For example how fake news is a dype of dark pattern.
	
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article was also my least favorite! I liked reading about the different solutions proposed.
							How bringing in cognitive science and persuasive design can add to a users experience, but ultimately it comes down to 
							the designers moral code, which I don't have an inate trust in humanity in this regard (least favorite part).
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> “When you use the web, you don’t read every word on every page — you skim read and make assumptions. 
							If a company wants to trick you into doing something, they can take advantage of it by making a page look like 
							it is saying one thing when in fact it is saying another. You can defend yourself against dark patterns on this site.”
