					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned there are so many curves that describe how an animation moves into/out of position.
								I also learned that you can define your own curve and their parameters using cubic-beziier.com.
								Linear motion looks very unnatural, I guess I knew this one, but hadn't really related how to fix it,
								which this article does. I was also thinking about animations for the midterm assignment, and noticed
								some of the things I had designedd would have benefited from animations and animation curves.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article as all of their animations! I especially liked the good  
								and bad animations that were side by side and shown simultaneously. These were useful 
								in getting their point across about the different animation curves and the do's and don'ts
								of animation.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "From these examples follows a fundamental rule that many beginners neglect â€” the beginning animation is not equal to the ending animation" 
								Thankful for this quote, as I am a beginner and would likely have negleted this. </p>
						</li>
