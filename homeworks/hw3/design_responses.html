						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that fonts can be easier or harder to read depending on who you are. Such as kids find certain fonts
								easier and seniors font needs are different. I hadn't considered this before when chosing a font. I also learned about
								font pairing and how it can be used to establish visual hierarchy. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was all of the linked material to help in selecting a font! 100 best free fonts was a 
								fav that not only listed fonts but also created 8 categories and described the motivation behind each font. Typewolf shows 
								what is trending in fonts and helps with type pairing.   
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Good design aligns its typography with its purpose. 
								This is because typography is key to setting mood, tone, and style in your designs." 
								I liked this because I hadn't considered how a font makes me feel, but it totally creates a mood and/or sets 
								a tone.
