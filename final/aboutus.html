            <p>Ben and Kate met 9 years ago whitewater kayaking in northern Cali. Less than 
                two years later they built out their first (of many) Sprinter vans and drove it 
                from Oregon to Panama with Benâ€™s DR650 motorcycle on the back. 
            </p>
            <p>Koda completed the family a few years later. Big changes are coming as we
                are transitioning back to living simply and adventuring more.
